% Example program, for processing laser scans, stored in a Matlab data file.
% It shows the scans in the original/native way :POLAR.
% You are requested to modify this program to show the data in Cartesian.


% The data correspond to a laser scanner  (LIDAR) installed at the front of our UGV
% (robot). It is pointing ahead the robot, scanning horizontally, i.e. in 2D
% When you plot the data in Cartesian you will see how the room did look
% from the perspective of the moving platform.


% IMPORTANT ==> Read the program and comments, before trying to modify it (and before asking the tutors).

% The data in the file is stored according to certain structure. 
% The fields we need are: "Scans" and "times".
% The number of scans is indicated by the field "N".
% The scans themselves are stored in the field "Scans", that is a matrix of 361 x N 
% (because each scan contains 361 measurements, which cover 180 degrees at steps of 1/2 degree).
% the ranges are originally expressed in Centimeters, as 13 bits unsigned int integers.
