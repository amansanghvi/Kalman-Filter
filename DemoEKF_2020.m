% DemoEKF.m - version 2020.T1
% MRTN4010 - S1.2020
% Example using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for the localization problem, using LIDAR range observations.
% Read and analyze this progam; it wll be used on Project 2.


% Note#1:
% For each "LIDAR scan" we extract the detected landmarks and then we use their ranges to update the estimated 
% states (3DoF: 2D position and heading of the platform).  
% Even frequently using "just" one range (related to some landmark) the estimator is
% able to estimate the pose (position and heading, 3DoF)!!!
% Q: How is this possible?
% A: This is because in addition to the observation model we use the process model (which correlates the states in time) as well.
% As the robot moves then we obtain several observations from different poses (and at different times).
% This system is what is said to be "Observable" 
% (its internal states can be estimated by observing its "outputs", in this case we measure the robot's distance to certain landmark/landmarks).

% it seems that having just range (1D) and certain process model we would
% be able to estimate (x,y, Phi)  (3DoF)! 
% analogy/question: can we do stereo vision with a perfect process model and just 1 eye? 
% analogy/question: can we do stereo vision with a "good but not perfect" process model and just 1 eye? 
% answer: YES; this problem is called "mapping" (given, approximately, out position, we estimate the position of OOIs)


% Note#2: in this simulation we run the process model at certain frequency
% (dt=50ms), however we do not assume we get measurements (for the observations) at that sample
% rate (that situation would be great!, but it is not always possible). We assume observations have a slower sample rate. This
% is to show that even for a poor system (observing at low rate) the estimation process is still good and feasible. 


%Note #3:
% You can change many things in this simulation (that is the beauty of testing things under simulations):
% 1)  the geographical distribution and number of landmarks.
% 2)  the noise's standard deviations in the inputs of the kinematic model of the vehicle
% 3)  the noise's standard deviations of range measurements
% 4)  the sampling rate of the scanner
% 5)  the inputs to the process (speed and angular rate)
% and a lot of things for experimenting!


% You will be requested, in a subsequent project, to 
%  1) Modify the update stage of the EKF for accepting bearing observations.
%  2) Adapt the Q matrix used in the prediction step, for properly
%  considering the noise that pollutes the model's inputs.



% Note4:  IMPORTANT
% a) You will need to modify the EKF update stage in order to deal with the
% cases:   Bearing Only and Range+Bearing (as required in a subsequent project).

% b) you need to adapt the Q matrix in the prediction stage, in order to
% consider the noise that pollutes the inputs of the process model (speed
% and gyroZ). Follow the approach presented in the lecture notes, in file
% "MTRN4010_L06_Noise_in_the_inputs_of_ProcessModel.pdf"

%---------------------------------

% In this problem we have a kinematic model of the platform ( our "process
% model"). The inputs, u(t), of the model are 2 :
%    a)  platform's speed (measured at the middle point between the back wheels) 
%    b)  Wz (yaw/heading angular rate), measured through  IMU's gyros.
